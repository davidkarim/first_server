## Sinatra Web server
This is my first implementation of a Sinatra server. The URL can take in a parameter (i.e. stock=msft) and the server will respond with a basic HTML formatted page that displays the stock information pulled from Yahoo finance.

I implemented the logic with Ruby httparty and nokogiri Gems to help pull and parse the data.
